â€¢ Objective : Time Series Forecasting of Wine Sales 
Tools and skills used : Time Series Analysis, ADF Test, ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, 
Forecasting, Data Cleaning, EDA, Statistical Modeling 
o Applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine trends, seasonality, variance, and sales distribution 
across years and months. 
o Performed time series decomposition and stationarity checks using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test 
to prepare data for modelling. 
o Developed and evaluated multiple models including Simple/Double/Triple Exponential Smoothing, 
Linear Regression, ARIMA, and SARIMA models using RMSE and AIC for model selection. 
o Identified Triple Exponential Smoothing and SARIMA as top-performing models with lowest RMSE and 
accurate seasonality tracking, providing reliable forecasts for future sales periods.
